  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This caramel macchiato ice cream is frozen bliss. It's a frosty, homemade version of that famous coffee shop's macchiato.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons instant coffee granules</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>Â¾ cup caramel dessert sauce</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Whisk together milk, sugar, instant coffee granules, and salt in a large bowl until sugar is dissolved. Stir in heavy cream. Cover the bowl and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours.</li>
    <li>Pour chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches soft-serve consistency. Transfer 1/2 of the ice cream to a one- or two-quart lidded plastic container. Pour 1/2 of the caramel sauce over the top, then repeat the layers with remaining ice cream and caramel. Swirl caramel into ice cream using a chopstick or knife.</li>
    <li>Cover ice cream surface with plastic wrap to seal. Allow ice cream to ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours or overnight for best results.</li>
