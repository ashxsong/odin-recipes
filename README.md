# Odin Recipes

This is a basic recipe website containing dessert recipes I find interesting. It includes the recipe images, descriptions, ingredients, and steps. I used HTML for this website. I created ordered and unordered lists to organize the components of the recipes. I also created headings and paragraphs as well as inserted images and relative links.
